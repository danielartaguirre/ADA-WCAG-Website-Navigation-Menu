This includes items such as, HTML tags, ARIA, roles, labels.

This will also include best practices for differet ADA website navigation such as:

#Screen Readers

##2018 Revised 508 Standards update to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

WCAG 2.1

WCAG 2.1 was published in 2018, adding 17 new success criteria (mostly focused on mobile accessibility, low vision, and cognitive disabilities).

Section 508 has not been formally updated to require WCAG 2.1.

# WCAG Compliance and Section 508 Reference

| Standard / Requirement | Legally Binding in U.S. | Notes |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| **Section 508 (2018 Revised Standards)** | **Yes** – requires **WCAG 2.0 AA** | Incorporated by reference. Federal agencies and contractors must meet these criteria. |
| **WCAG 2.0 (2008)** | **Yes (AA only)** via Section 508 | Baseline requirement for compliance. |
| **WCAG 2.1 (2018)** | **No (not codified)** | Adds 17 new success criteria (mobile, low vision, cognitive). **Frequently referenced in ADA lawsuits and settlements**, and often required in RFPs/procurement. |
| **WCAG 2.2 (2023)** | **No (not codified)** | Adds 9 new success criteria (e.g., Target Size 2.5.8, Focus Not Obscured). Considered **best practice** for future-proofing. May influence future Section 508 updates. |

## Practical Guidance
- **Minimum legal requirement (federal):** WCAG 2.0 AA.  
- **Best practice today:** WCAG 2.1 AA.  
- **Future-proofing / next wave:** WCAG 2.2 AA.  
- **Lawsuits and DOJ actions:** Often cite WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 even though Section 508 only references 2.0.  

---

## Summary
- If you work with **federal agencies** → you *must* meet WCAG 2.0 AA.  
- If you serve the **public sector or private market** → expect WCAG 2.1 AA as the de facto standard.  
- If you want to **avoid future rework and legal exposure** → design/build to WCAG 2.2 AA now.


However:

Agencies and contractors are encouraged to follow WCAG 2.1 because it builds on 2.0 and aligns with international best practices.

Some procurement or agency-specific requirements already request WCAG 2.1 AA compliance voluntarily.
