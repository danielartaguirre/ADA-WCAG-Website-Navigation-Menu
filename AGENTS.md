# Agent Instructions

When adding or updating references to WCAG success criteria:

- Link to the specific guideline page on [WCAG.com](https://www.wcag.com/) rather than the homepage.
- Use the corresponding developers or designers URL, for example:
  - `https://www.wcag.com/developers/<slug>/`
  - `https://www.wcag.com/designers/<slug>/`
- If multiple success criteria are discussed together, include separate WCAG.com links for each.
